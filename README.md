# AllKindsOfBiTrees
During the leetcode practing,I readlized that I need some tools to test my binary tree related answer.So here it is.

using "AllKinds" is not like the picture below(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#Mathematical_definition) ,
at least for now,I just want to finish most kind of trees appear on leetcode's tests like:
  binary search tree/AVL tree（named after inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis）/red-black tree/B tree/B+ tree
